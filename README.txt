DiceRoll.py outputs a number in the range of 1-6.

—————Version2————
DiceRoll.py now asks the user for the number of sides on the die that the user wants to roll, and outputs the result. If the user does not input an integer into the field for the number of sides, a try-except function will catch that and print “that’s not a number”

—————Version3————-
DiceRoll.py now uses int_input to accomplish the earlier task.

—————Version4—————
DiceRoll.py now has a different name in the initial section. Also I created a DiceRoll_V2.py.
